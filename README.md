> :warning: This repository has been archived since we unified the source code for both .NET and .NET-Core clients a while back. The last release done here was 6.2.3 and this repo won't receive any further maintenance as the source code for the client current versions is not kept here anymore.

## Compatibility
This SDK is compatible with NET Framework 4.0 and above and NET Core 1.x, 2.x and 3.0.

## Getting started
Below is a simple example that describes the instantiation and most basic usage of our SDK:

```c#
var config = new ConfigurationOptions();
var factory = new SplitFactory("SDK_API_KEY", config);
var sdk = factory.Client();

try
{
    sdk.BlockUntilReady(10000);
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    // log & handle 
}

var treatment = sdk.GetTreatment("CUSTOMER_ID","SPLIT_NAME");

if (treatment == "on") 
{
    // insert code here to show on treatment
} 
else if (treatment == "off") 
{
    // insert code here to show off treatment 
} 
else 
{
    // insert your control treatment code here
}
```
